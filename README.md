# Anime25
An analysis of the last 25 years of anime, season by season.


## What this is
Essentially, this was a project done to measure the perceived quality of anime as well as examine how the tastes of anime fans have changed over time. To do so, I obtained the top 20 anime (by MyAnimeList rating) from each season from Winter 1999 to Fall 2024. I went with a 25-year timespan to ensure that I was obtaining the vast majority of the anime that are culturally relevant in 2022 and that I was properly representing the tastes of fans in 2022 as much as I possibly could.

## Technologies Used
I used Python (Pandas & Requests) as well as the Jikan REST API v4 for MyAnimeList. But that's obvious if you read the code.

# Data & Analysis

**Average Rating of Top 20 Anime per Season (1999-2024)**

![Average Rating Of Top 20 Anime Per Season (99-24)](https://github.com/manga-guy/Anime25/assets/68157143/9b2d586a-a864-43ce-bf1e-daf6ae5c1fd6)

**Trend Analysis**: What we observe is that, throughout the entire 25-year time period, there average rating of the top 20 anime from each season remains relatively constant. There are slight boom and bust periods that likely coincide with things that did and did not drive a lot of interest.

**Average Rating:** 7.4

**Average Viewer Count of Top 20 Anime per Season (1999-2024)**

**Trend Observation**: We can observe the average viewer count growing pretty steadily over the 25-year period. This is likely due to the growth in the popularity of anime as well as the increased availability of anime on streaming services.

**Average Viewer Count**: Average viewer count across each season’s top 25 is 363,387.

**Overall Thoughts**

1. **Ratings Stay Roughly the Same**: despite the years passing by and tastes changing, it appears that the overall ratings and opinions on heavily watched series are roughly the same as they were in decades past.
2. **Increasing Viewer Counts**: The anime community continues to grow, boosting the viewer counts to levels that would have been unusual in years prior.
3. **Fluctuations in Ratings**: Fluctuations in ratings may have something to do with there being a higher level of interest in some seasons of anime vs others based on the series that were available during that time.

- The Greatest Season???
    - **Summer 2016** has an average viewer count of **over 830,000** for its top 20 anime.
        - Many popular anime released at this time including:
            - Your Name
            - A Silent Voice
            - Mob Psycho 100
            - Food Wars! The Second Plate (Food Wars’ Second Season)
            - The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.
            - ReLIFE
            - Orange
            - 91 Days
            - Kizumonogatari II: Nekketsu-hen
            - Berserk (2016)
            - The Seven Deadly Sins: Signs of Holy War
        - Being that many of these anime are still culturally relevant in 2022, it is no surprise that the viewership of these series has been so high. We also have to factor in the fact that Your Name and a Silent Voice will be fan favorites for generations to come.
- Worst Season Overall:
    - **Winter 2000**
        - Some of the only notable anime include:
            - One Piece Movie 1
            - Boogiepop Phantom
            - Digimon Adventure: Our War Game (Movie)
            - Doraemon Movie 21
        - While I remember Boogiepop Phantom having a niche fanbase, it appears that the only anime that are still culturally relevant from this period are spinoffs of established franchises. Pucca also was released if anyone cares. I like Pucca if no one else does. Shinzo was released during this period as well. But honestly, this is just me coping.

## Retro:

I did this for the love of anime and to see how things changed over time. As expected, there were some extremely high points during the mid-2010s because many of those series were not only popular upon release but have become part of the modern anime "canon". Things like Your Name, A Silent Voice, Attack on Titan, Re:Zero, and others are likely only going to grow in terms of popularity, despite not being at the absolute forefront of what's happening in anime at the moment. Ultimately, it appears that these mid-2010s series may end up driving the popularity of anime among newer fans (along with even fresher titles like Jujutsu Kaisen and Spy x Family).

In terms of limitations, I did not analyze the entirety of each season and restricted my analysis to the top 20 anime in each season for the last 25 years. I do not think the impact of this decision would drastically change my analysis, being that there aren't really more than 20 anime per season that have an outsized cultural impact and grow to have a massive fanbase or even become a cult classic. If I were to conduct this analysis again, however (and had access to a bit more compute lol) I may do every single anime just for funsies. This was fun though.
