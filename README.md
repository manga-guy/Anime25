# Anime25
An analysis of the last 25 years of anime, season by season.


## What this is
Essentially, this was a project done to measure the perceived quality of anime as well as examine how the tastes of anime fans have changed over time. To do so, I obtained the top 20 anime (by MyAnimeList rating) from each season from Winter 1999 to Fall 2024. I went with a 25-year timespan to ensure that I was obtaining the vast majority of the anime that are culturally relevant in 2022 and that I was properly representing the tastes of fans in 2022 as much as I possibly could.

## Technologies Used
I used Python (Pandas & Requests) as well as the Jikan REST API v4 for MyAnimeList. But that's obvious if you read the code.
